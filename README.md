I am a coding practitioner who is also a learner in this field. Trying to find the beautiful things that technologies can offer and following after it to grasp the meaning that it has hidden inside.No big deal.

Hi!In this repository,I will add all my codes that I would practice in future days.It is like a online diary to keep track of my progress.In some cases, I may not be able to stay with my pc ,then I would be able to access in this repository and with the source codes of specific programming languages I uploaded in this place, I would easily stay connected with all the materials and this will allow to remain connected with codes everywhere.

Lastly I wanna say one more thing.It is that Code is a powerful weapon possessing lots of possibilities that can't be ignored.
